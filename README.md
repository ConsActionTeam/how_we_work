Welcome! This repo serves as a central hub for information on our values and how we work together. In particular, please see our:

- [Working Agreement](working_agreement.md)
- [Onboard Guide](onboarding.md) for new members
- [Data Management Guide](data-management.md) for open science
- [Offboarding Guide](offboarding.md)

It's also worth checking out our [Methods repo](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods), including our [Cookbook](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/blob/master/cookbook.md) on how to solve common research problems we all face.

These resources were modified from the [Pinksy lab](github.com/pinksylab). Many thanks to them for their excellent materials and making them publicly available to help improve lab culture and scientific practices
